# Twilio Translate Challenge

You have applied for a job at a leading global communication brand. The initial meeting went well and they have now asked you to complete the following code test.

##Â The challenge

Using Twilio's _Programmable SMS_ product, and the _Yandex_ translate API, create a web service that will allow a user to send an SMS to a phone number, whilst at the same time translating the message into another language.

The application you produce should have a single endpoint `/message` which handles the following data:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello World!",
  "lang": "fr",
  "tel": "+447777123456"
}
```

This would instruct the service to translate _Hello World!_ into French, before sending the translation to the number _+447777123456_ via SMS.

Once it has translated the message and sent the SMS, it should return the following response:

```json
{
  "message": "Translation successful. Message sent."
}
```

The user should be able to translate their message to any language code from those supported by the Yandex API.

## Setup

To complete the challenge you will need to:

* [Sign up for a Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
* [Sign up for a Yandex account](https://passport.yandex.com/registration)

You can use any language or framework to complete the challenge.

## Tips

* Work in a pair or a small team for this task. **You should not see this as a competition**, but instead a fun challenge to help you get more comfortable with reading documentation and using online resources and tutorials.
* Break the challenge down into separate chunks:
  * Send a simple SMS with Twilio.
  * Translate a phrase with Yandex.
  * Send a translated phrase via SMS.
  * Setup Express to create the endpoint.
* The Twilio console can be a little hard to navigate. Once on the console, click on the large *Products* tab at the top of the page, then select _Programmable SMS_. You will then be prompted to name your project before you can access the _SID_ and _TOKEN_ you will need to use the Twilio API.
* Using Twilio's free account, you can only send SMS to phone numbers that have been added to the project dashboard on the Twilio site. We suggest that you add a range of numbers of your fellow students so that you can test the endpoint thoroughly.
* You will need to make a HTTP request to the Yandex API from Node.JS to make a translation. This is very similar to making an AJAX request from the client-side. You can use any node module you like for this, but we would recommend using the [Request Promise library](https://github.com/request/request-promise).
* You should store all the API keys and secrets in an `.env` file, and active them using the [dotenv module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

_Have fun, and happy coding!_
