# JavaScript TDD Array Methods Lab

In the starter code you have a file containing a number of tests, and a file with a series of problems to solve. the problems can be solved using what you know about array methods.

```bash
starter-code
├── index.html
├── problems.js
└── tests.js
```

To run the tests simply open the index.html file in your browser:

```bash
$ open index.html
```

Write your solutions in the `problems.js` file. To check your progress, simply reload the browser.

## Tips
- Use the console and `console.log` to help you experiment as you work.
- Work through the problems one at a time.
- You are not expected to complete all the problems.
- If you've been struggling with a problem for a while, skip it and move on to the next one.
- Feel free to work with a friend or colleague.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- Once you are finished, take a look through the `tests.js` file to become more aquainted with what automated tests look like.

## Bonus
- Come up with a few problems of your own and write tests for them
- Check that you can make the tests pass **and fail!**
