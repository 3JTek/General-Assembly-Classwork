# HTML Lab

### Introduction

In order to practice writing HTML, take the starter code provided and add tags to the text in the `index.html` file in a semantically appropriate way. The screenshot below shows the layout of the finished styled website. We will be looking at CSS tomorrow, so today just focus on how you would structure your HTML.

### Instructions

Working in pairs, using the starter code and screenshot above, add the following tags to the `index.html` file. There isn't one "correct" solution to this lab, but this is a chance for you to discuss with your parter which tags you think make sense semantically.

* `<header>`
* `<nav>`
* `<main>`
* `<h1>`, `<h2>` etc.
* `<a>`
* `<p>`
* `<form>`
* `<input>`
* `<img>`
* `<ul>`
* `<li>`
* `<section>`
* `<aside>`
* `<article>`
* `<footer>`

You will find the images inside the `images` directory. When you are adding the `src` attribute to the `<img>` tags, you will need to prefix the name of the file with `images/`.

**Note:** There are 2 forms on the page, one for the search and one for the email subscription. These both have submit buttons, that are styled in slightly different ways. When you are marking up your forms, remember to add the submit buttons.
